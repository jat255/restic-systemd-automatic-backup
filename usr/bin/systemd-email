# According to
# http://www.flashissue.com/blog/gmail-sending-limits/
# Gmail blocks your account if you send more than 500 emails per day, which is one email every
# (24 * 60 * 60) / 500 = 172.8 second => choose a min wait time which is significantly longer than this to be on the safe time to not exceed 500 emails per day.
# However this source
# https://group-mail.com/sending-email/email-send-limits-and-options/
# says the limit when not using the Gmail webinterface but going directly to the SMTP server is 100-150 per day, which yelds maximum one email every
# (24 * 60 * 60) / 100 = 864 second
# One option that I used with my old Axis cameras it to use my gmx.com accunt for sending emails instead, as there are (no?) higher limits there.
